# Streamlit x Flask x Stripe üå∂Ô∏è
Monetize your streamlit apps with Stripe and Flask

## Getting Started

### Running the app locally
```sh
# running the streamlit app
streamlit run üè°Home.py
# running the flask app (for webhooks)
flask --app flask_app run
# Stripe Development Environment:
stripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:5000/stripe_webhook
# Then you can purchase a product from the streamlit app and see the webhook response in the terminal
```

## Understanding the Code

### Accepting Payments
We will be using Stripe to accept payments. Stripe is a payment processing platform that allows you to accept payments and manage your business.

Look at `get_create_checkout_session_url` in `utils/stripe.py` to see how we create a checkout session. 


### Webhooks
We need a way of verifying that the payment was successful. We can do this by using webhooks. 

Webhooks are a way of sending a message from one application to another when something happens. In this case, we want stripe to send a message to our streamlit app when a payment is successful.

See the `stripe_webhook` function in `flask_app.py` to see how we handle the webhook.
